## Day 0 : 17 September 2019

**Thoughts before starting:** I have already begun this venture but couldn't do justice to it. Let's see how much I can do this time. This is my failed attempt again after 15 days.

**Today's progress:** Fixed on one langauge i.e Python. Completed few problems.

**Thoughts after completing:** The work is still in progress, scared that will skip this routine agian, but making sure will continue this.

**Next day rough plan:** More programing practice and problems.

# Day : 18 September 2019

**Thoughts before starting:** I thought I would skip todays day due to the college works but made up mind and sat doing.

**Today's progress:** Did go through few more concepts in python, but ended up doing competional programming in c++.

**Thoughts after completing:** Feels like I still need to figure out what my base languge should be, for placements C++ would do fine, but to do projects and other stuff.

**Next day rough plan:** More algorithms and datastructure problems.
